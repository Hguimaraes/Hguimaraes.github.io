I'm a Ph.D. student in Telecommunications at [INRS](http://inrs.ca/) under the supervision of Prof. [Tiago Falk](https://inrs.ca/en/research/professors/tiago-h-falk/). My research interest lies in efficient deep learning (e.g., Model compression and Efficient architectures), representation learning, and self-supervised learning for speech and language processing (SLP). In addition, I aim to build efficient speech representation learning algorithms robust to distribution shifts and malicious users.

Previously, I worked as a senior data scientist at [Ita√∫-Unibanco](https://www.itau.com.br/), where I was responsible for developing a wide range of ML solutions to handle tabular data, speech, and NLP, from conception to large-scale deployment, impacting more than 20 million users. In the past, I also had some internship experiences with investment funds and in the O&G fields. On the academic side, I have received my M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering at [USP](https://www5.usp.br/), a Specialization in Data Science at [ITA](http://www.ita.br/), and my B.S. in Computer and Information Engineering from [UFRJ](https://ufrj.br/en/).

<!-- Occasionally, I advisor and/or consult for companies, where I collaborate in three directions: (i) providing in-company training and mentoring for business analysts and managers to achieve a data-centric/driven culture; (ii) recruitment process: resume screening and technical assessment; and (iii) as a part-time technical leader for developing solutions directly impacting the company's mission. -->

For more details, please take a look at my [CV](http://hguimaraes.me/assets/pdf/Academic_CV.pdf) (last update: 2023/03/01).

Apart from my professional interests, I like to practice Wushu (lineage: **Wu Ji Tang Lang Men**), and I enjoy the **Beat Generation** literary movement, mainly the works of Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Cassady.
